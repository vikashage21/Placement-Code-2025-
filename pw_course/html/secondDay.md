# Notes

## _Resume Building_

- The resume should **not** be in PDF format because whenever an opportunity comes, it should be easily editable.
- The resume should **speak for itself** â€“ be clear, concise, and impactful.
- A **purpose/summary** section should be written at the top of the resume.
- **Skills** should be written in **bold** to highlight them clearly.
- For **freshers**, you should add:
  - **Internship experiences**
  - **Project details**
  - **Technologies** used
